Exploratory Data Analysis using Python to understanding the Credit Default Factors.

This project was created on the Jupyter notebook.

It’s generally a good idea to put the data in the same folder as your project, or in a subfolder, to make relative paths and loading the data easier. So the data files needs to be present in the same path.

Project Goal:
The loan providing companies find it hard to give loans to the people due to their
insufficient or non existent credit history. When the company receives a loan
application, the company has to decide for loan approval based on the applicant s
profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank s decision:
●
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results
in a loss of business to the company.
●
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default,
then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.
This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if a client has difficulty
paying their instalments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the
loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher
interest rate, etc. In other words, the company wants to understand the driving
factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are
strong indicators of default.
